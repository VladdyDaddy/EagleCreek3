                        but with great private feel and layout. Great for large
                        gatherings, large living room, kitchen, and large bar with
                        card table, 3 TVs, every appliance and utensil needed for a
                        large party. Beautiful lighted backyard, with large deck, plenty of
                        chairs, grill, and idyllic stream running by property. As bonus a great
                        fishing spot 20 yards away. Hard to beat the place for appointments and comfort.
                        Owners extremely helpful. Makes spending $$$ for single room in hotel near campus
                        hard to justify."

                        "Our stay at Eagle Creek Lodge was amazing! We celebrated our daughter’s
                        30th birthday on a Penn State game weekend! The lodge has everything you
                        need for a large group. There were 20 of us and two refrigerators were perfect
                        for all the food we had! Two keurigs made breakfast coffee convenient and easy for
                        all. There is plenty of seating and beds and the outdoor amenities are perfect for
                        a bonfire or walk in the woods or just sitting by the creek. The lodge is an easy 15-20min
                        drive or uber ride to downtown State College! We arrived a little earlier than expected, but
                        Mike was there in a minute to show us around and was more than accommodating. We are already
                        booked for a weekend next fall!!."

                        "We had such a lovely time visiting the lodge. We had several families stay and everyone
                        raved about how fun it was to all stay together in one space. The fire pit and deck space
                        gave us lots of room to spread out. The kitchen was well-stocked, and there were plenty of
                        towels and extra sheets. It was great to have two refrigerators and so many coolers outside.
                        The row of outlets in the kitchen for crock pots and phone chargers is a brilliant touch and
                        indicative of the thought that went into designing the cabin space. Parking was plentiful.
                        At night, the outdoor space is really magical with twinkling lights in the trees and a huge
                        fire pit that sat a dozen people. We will definitely stay again, and perhaps next time get a
                        chance to explore the creek some more. Thank you Powers family!"

                        More than enough room for a group of that size. The property had a large well stocked kitchen,
                        plenty of towels and bed linens, 3 large TVs, and the cabin (indoors and outdoors) was wired
                        with speakers. The outdoor area had a large deck (perfect for playing cornhole) and a large
                        firepit. Another excellent feature was a large parking lot. We had no issues getting Uber and
                        Lift rides down to State College. Michael and Justine the owners were great hosts, very easy
                        to get ahold of for questions and very accommodating. Our group will certainly be making a
                        return visit to the property."

                        brother (a Penn State alumni). We had 12 guys there and everyone was super comfortable.
                        The kitchen was filled with all the pots and pans I needed to cook for the gang and it
                        even had a crock pot (or three!) that I could make a chili in! And the setup of the house
                        was ideal for the group. With large TVs in every room we were able to watch sports and movies
                        throughout the weekend. The real gem is the outdoor area. We had great weather one of the
                        nights so we were able to make a great fire in the truly enormous fire pit. We were out
                        there until very late without disturbing anyone, so the location is great! I'd recommend
                        this house to anyone, in fact we are looking at our calendars right now to maybe book another
                        weekend there (this time during football season!)."
